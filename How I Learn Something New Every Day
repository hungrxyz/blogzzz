There's a few questions I ask myself when I need/want to learn something:
  - Will it help me achieve what I'm after?
  - Will it make things easier for me?
  - What all can I do with my new skill?

I discovered that the fastest way for me to learn something is by doing it. That
means that I do a lot of tutorials.

Trello. I use Trello for keeping track of which tutorials I've already done or
still have to do. Instead of searching for tutorials every day I once or twice
a week all the tutorial sites to see if there are any new tutorials that I'm
interested in. In case there is a new tutorial I take the url and title and
create a new card from it in my "Learning - 1 Card A Day" list, which holds the
references of the tutorials that need to be done. So when that time in teh day
comes that I decide to go through a tutorial, I just go to this list and pick
the first one (usually). When I'm done with the tutorial, I move the card to
the "Done" list. This allows me to get a tutorial quick w/o the need to search
around the internet and I don't have to think about which ones I've alraedy done
so it's organized nicely.
