There's a few questions I ask myself when I need/want to learn something:
  - Will it help me achieve what I'm after?
  - Will it make things easier for me?
  - What all can I do with my new skill?

I discovered that the fastest way for me to learn something is by doing it. That
means that I do a lot of tutorials.
