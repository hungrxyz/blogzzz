It's a productivity tool to get things done, not to not forget things

From the start this app was designed around helping people get things done.

I had a problem. I wasn't where I wanted to be, I knew what I had to do to get
there but it didn't do anything about it. Excuses, never ending excuses were
paralyzing me from growing and achieving my goals. Something needed to change
so I started thinking and searching for the source of what is holding me back.
Of course the answer was myself, but I needed to dig deeper into how I know what
I need to do to achieve the goal and what a great feeling it is once you get
there but I still couldn't do it. Turns out I'm having a hard time doings tasks
that don't bring me the short-term excitement. Fear of doing a lot of small
tasks over a long period of time was smaller than fear of missing out on all the
other opportunities that are presenting itself while being in for the long run.
It was very easy for me to get overwhelmed by my ambitious and dreamy goals
while comparing myself to Elon Musk or Steve Jobs all the time even though I
knew it took the 10+ years to build something meaningful and valuable. I still
have that problem but I think I'm holding on pretty good for now.
