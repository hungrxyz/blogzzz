I was surprised how big the tech scene in NYC is. I thought NYC was all about
fashions, finance and movies.

To better compare all the meetups I will break them down into two different
categories: Meetups With Talks and Collaborative programming meetups.

Meetups with talks:

    Hosted around different startups in Brooklyn.
    Very insightful talks from really experienced people in the field like
    Veronica Ray, Tamar Nachmany, Soroush Khanlou and more...

    of the event was a bit weak, but the theme was interesting.
