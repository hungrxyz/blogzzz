Living with human robots

Coming back to Slovenia after spending 9 months abroad was very hard for me,
especially because the 3 months I spent in NYC were the best 3 months of my
life. Living home on a hill in s small Village very close to the Austrian border
is very painful.

Motivation is always a problem in that kind of environment. Because they are not
used of jobs where you create for a living, and not even art. But like
programming, which is mostly referenced as "Playing with the computer" falls
short compared to a job like packing shampoo into carton or working in a call
center, basically anything where you don't have any responsibilities beside
watching out for yourself.

Communication! Works only if they like and understand what you are saying. They
do not want to think about what you said. So if I don't like something and try
to present my problem, I would always get back a generic answer like: "You are
wierd!", "Where did you come from?!", "You are thinking to much!", "We didn't
raise you like that!". Which can be very frustrating for when they present
something they don't like and I'm listening and actually thinking of solutions
on how to accommodate them and they don't even care. It seems like they
just wanted to complain at the end, nothing more that that.
