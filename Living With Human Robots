Living with human robots

Coming back to Slovenia after spending 9 months abroad was very hard for me,
especially because the 3 months I spent in NYC were the best 3 months of my life.
Living home on a hill in s small Village very close to the Austrian border is very
painfull.

Motivation is always a problem in that kind of environment. Because they are not
used of jobs where you create for a living, and not even art. But like programming,
which is mostly referenced as "Playing with the computer" falls short compared to
a job like packing shampoo into carton or working in a call center, basically
anything where you don't have any responsibilities beside watching out for yourself.
