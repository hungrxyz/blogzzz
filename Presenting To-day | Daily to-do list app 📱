Presenting To-day | Daily to-do list app ðŸ“±

There's a lot of to-do list on the App Store and I think there's always room for
more. I'm having a lot of problems getting things done just because I feel like
whatever I do or create is not worth anything. I love creating though, and iOS
Development is what allows me to transform simple ideas into reality very easily.

App needs a story. What is the story behind this app?

I'm a very self-conscious person with big ambitions and dreams. These two
characteristics don't go hand in hand well so I have to improvise a lot to get
where I want to be. One thing I do is I make apps to help me out with that.
To-day is one of them and after using it for a couple of months (while building
it) I decided to release it into the public and maybe help others too. This is a
special moment for me because I don't approve of a lot of things I make.

How it helps me: I tried many to-do lists and they just don't seem to work for
me so I took the initial concept of a to-do list and started thinking of how to
make it work for me. First thing that came up was that once I put a task on the
list, it just stays there until I mark it as complete or delete it.

I didn't build To-day to not forget what to do, I built it to help get things
done. I tend to procrastinate a lot just because whenever I want to start
working on something I get the feeling that it's gonna be irrelevant. Reading
through one of the countless articles about how to fight procrastination I tried
experimenting with writing down what I need to do since it should help you get
it done. So I took that approach and started building an app around the idea of
writing down tasks you need to do.

Next thing that was important is I don't want to have my list cluttered the next
day with all the tasks from yesterday and before that. That's where the idea
for reseting the list every day came from, and because I tend to work though the
night a lot I made the reset time to 5 AM. This also presented a motive for
completing the task today because tomorrow it will be gone. And since I hate the
feeling of setting something for the day and not completing it it motivates me
to complete it before the list resets and I can go to sleep with a good feeling
because I did everything I set out to do today.

Story:
I'm a very self-conscious person with big ambitions and dreams. These two
characteristics don't go hand in hand well so I have to improvise a lot to get
where I want to be. A thing I do a lot is just brainstorm why I don't get the
results I'm aiming for and how to improve that. Once I get an idea on what I
think could help me, I start thinking about what kind of app I could build for
it.

The sole purpose of this app is to write down the thing you need to do and do it

================================================================================

Introducing To-day, daily to-do list app,

What is about? The one sole purpose of this app is to write down the things you need to do to today and get them done.

Key feature of the app is that the list resets every morning so you don't need to remove all the tasks from the days before. It also acts as a deadline because once 5 AM hits the clock, tasks are stored away without the option to edit them. I don't know about you but I absolutely hate the feeling of not doing the things that I set out to do. With To-day I sort of force myself into the position of do it or feel bad looking at that bold unstrikedthrough task on the top of the list.

A bit about the functionality. The app uses simple swipe gestures to perform most of the actions.

By pulling the list down and releasing, when it says "release to add new task", new task will be added to the top of the list and the keyboard will slide up for you to title it. For convenience you can add a new task while adding a new task.

Swiping right on a task will mark the task as done or undone, depending on the current state. If you swipe to the right the way, the task will be deleted.

And to edit the name of the task, just tap on it.
